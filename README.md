Mister Studio presents “Foodtopia: Pick Your Food”, the ultimate way to educate kids on picky eating and unhealthy eating!\n
The target audience of the game is picky eaters aged between 5-8. Through our game we hope to reshape their views on food by turning foods that are commonly disliked due to appearance or smell to something that they are more comfortable experimenting with.
We also strive to teach the children the basics of nutrition, importance of healthy eating and help them realize some of the horrible ingredients that go into the junk foods children often consume and love. Commonly known as the “can I please eat … for breakfast?” foods.
In this virtual game environment, we hope to teach kids how to lead a fun, healthy and educational lifestyle!
In addition, this game is recommended to be played with an adult so they can help further explain, emphasize, or read aloud any information to the child as there is no audio component (which can possibly be a future addition).
